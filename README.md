# Spectral Indices Analysis using geospatial frameworks
This repository contains some python using geemap and earth engine api for analysis of NDVI , NDBI and MNDWI indices over a time span of two decades.

Several *Unit Test* scripts are also available for future experiments. All the unit tests are provided in the notebook (.ipynb) format and can be directly executed at the users end.
